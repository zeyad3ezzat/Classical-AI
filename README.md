# Playing Agents
You are required to provide four playing (Non-AI) agents, and four playing AI agents.

Non-AI Agents:

1. A human agent, that can make actions using the GUI.

2. A completely passive agent, that places all of its bonus armies to the territory with
the fewest armies, and doesn't make any attacks.

3. An aggressive agent, that always places all its bonus armies on the territory with
the most armies, and greedily attempts to attack territories with most armies that
he can attack.

4. A nearly pacifist agent, that places its armies like the completely passive agent, then
conquers only the one territory with fewest armies (if it can).

AI Agents:

1. A greedy agent, that picks the move with best immediate heuristic value.

2. An agent using A* search, with the same heuristic.

3. An agent using real-time A*.

4. A Minimax with alpha-beta pruning agent.
